      <description>Performing in front of a broader audience was such a stressful experience for me in the past! Thankfully, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to overcome some of my fears (or at least - accept them) and now public speaking is one of the most enjoyable forms of knowledge sharing I&amp;rsquo;m involved in. Below you can find slides from some of the talks I made in the past.

      <description>My name is Przemek Smyrdek, I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer and knowledge sharing advocate. I want to help you grow and work better by sharing everything I learned during my programming journey.
For the most part of my career I&amp;rsquo;ve been focused on web development (front-end, to be more precise), but after falling in love with knowledge sharing I decided to extend my areas of interest with activities like writing, public speaking and podcasting.</description>
